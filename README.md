A website is a collection of interconnected web pages that share a common domain name. It's like a digital storefront or information hub accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
Key Components of a Website:

    Web pages: Individual HTML documents that make up the website.
    Domain name: The address used to find the website (e.g., example.com).
    Web server: The computer that stores and delivers the website's files.
    Hyperlinks: Links that connect different web pages within the website and to external resources.
